#  What is ?

, also known as simply , is a crypto-currency and payment system created by Satoshi Nakamoto. released in 2009 as open-source software. are created through a process called "mining". They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100 thousand merchants and vendors accepted as payment.

# How does work?

works by solving a complex mathematical problem. When was first released, could be mined on average using home computers. Today, however, more powerful mining hardware is required to create new . The mathematical problem becomes more difficult to solve as more are mined, ensuring that the rate of minting new remain steady.

# History of

The creator of has remained anonymous since its inception, but speculation about Nakamoto's identity continues. In 2010, applied for an patent application naming , claiming to cover a digital currency system. The patent was granted in August 2012. The issuance of a patent application has been interpreted by some as evidence that Nakamoto was actually two people: Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry who filed the application together. Other suspects include Jed McCaleb, creator of the eDonkey network and bitcoin predecessor ; FinCEN Formal Investigation : In March 2013,. issued an inquiry to about the possibility that had violated money transmitter regulations in connection with its operations.

Several other exchanges were investigated over the following months. In June 2013,. obtained a license from FinCEN to operate as a money transmitter in most of the United States

#  What does ? mean?

? is a symbol used in mathematics and many other areas of study. It is most commonly known as the symbol for an unknown or undefined quantity. When used in equations or formulas, it usually indicates that a particular result is not known and needs to be determined.

In many cases, the use of ? can be replaced by the word "unknown." For example, the equation A+B=C could be written A+B=C? to indicate that C is an unknown quantity. However, this can also be interpreted as A plus B equals C mutiplied by 1/2.

There are many ways to solve for an unknown quantity in a mathematical equation. One common method is to use inverse operations. This occurs when the operation that was used to calculate the unknown quantity is reversed in order to find the answer. For example, if an equation includes division, then multiplying by the reciprocal will solve for the unknown quantity.

#  Who created ?? 

The art of who created is a timeless question that has been asked throughout the ages. While there have been many theories over who created, there is no clear answer. Some believe that it was a deity that created the universe, while others believe that it was simply an unknown force.

No matter what the answer is, it is an interesting topic to think about. Who created the universe and why? There are many different theories out there, and it is up to each individual to decide which one they believe in.

Some people believe that there is no answer to this question, and that it is something that we may never know. But, even if we never find out who created the universe, it is still an interesting topic to think about. It can help us to better understand ourselves and our place in the world.

Ultimately, the answer to this question is something that we may never know for sure. But, it is still an interesting topic to contemplate. Who knows â€“ maybe one day we will find out for sure who created the universe!

#  Why was ? created?

? was created to help people improve their productivity and make their work easier. It is an online tool that allows users to create and share documents with others.

? was also created to help people in businesses and organizations collaborate more effectively. It enables users to share ideas and work on projects together.

Finally, ? was designed to help students and professionals learn new skills. It provides access to educational materials and allows users to collaborate with others who have expertise in the subject matter.

#  When and where did ? originate?

The ? symbol is believed to have originated in the late 1800s, when one of its earliest uses was in railroad signaling. The Railroad Commission of Texas used a ? lantern signal to indicate to engineers that they needed to slow down.
